Key Add-Ons for Insurance for 2 Wheeler
In addition to standard coverage, you can enhance your insurance for 2 wheeler policy by opting for add-ons. These optional coverages provide additional benefits and further protect your vehicle in specific scenarios.

1. Zero Depreciation Cover
With a zero depreciation cover, the insurance company pays for the full value of replaced parts without considering depreciation. This is especially useful for new vehicles or expensive repairs, as it ensures you don’t have to pay out of pocket for depreciated parts.

2. Roadside Assistance
This add-on provides 24/7 roadside assistance in case your bike breaks down or you encounter other issues while on the road. From flat tires to towing services, this coverage ensures that help is always available when needed.

3. Engine Protection Cover
Two-wheeler engines are vulnerable to damage due to waterlogging or oil leaks. An engine protection cover ensures that any repair costs related to the engine are taken care of by your insurance provider.

4. Consumables Cover
Consumables like engine oil, nuts, bolts, and screws are often not covered under a regular policy. With a consumables cover add-on, these items will also be included, reducing your repair costs further.

Factors to Consider When Choosing Insurance for 2 Wheeler
Selecting the right insurance for 2 wheeler involves considering several factors. It's important to evaluate your own needs and the options available before making a decision.

1. Premium vs Coverage
While it's tempting to opt for the lowest premium, it’s essential to balance affordability with adequate coverage. A cheaper policy may not provide sufficient protection, leaving you financially vulnerable. Make sure to evaluate what’s included in the coverage and ensure that it meets your needs.

2. Claim Settlement Ratio
The claim settlement ratio is a critical factor to consider. This ratio indicates the percentage of claims settled by the insurer compared to the total claims received. A high claim settlement ratio means that the insurer is more reliable and likely to settle your claim promptly.

3. Network of Garages
Most insurers have a network of authorized garages where policyholders can get their vehicles repaired. Choosing an insurer with a wide network ensures you can easily find a garage near you, offering cashless repair services and convenience.

4. Customer Support
Good customer support is vital when dealing with any insurance provider. Whether you're filing a claim or simply asking questions about your policy, reliable customer service can make the process smoother and less stressful.

Notify the Insurer: Inform your insurance provider immediately after an accident or theft. Provide details of the incident and follow their guidance for next steps.

Document the Incident: Take photos of the damage and collect any other necessary documentation (such as a police report in case of theft or a major accident).

Submit Claim Form: Fill out the claim form provided by the insurer and submit it along with the required documentation.

Vehicle Inspection: In some cases, the insurer may send a surveyor to inspect the damage. Once the inspection is done, the claim will be processed.
